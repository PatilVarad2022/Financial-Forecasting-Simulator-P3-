  decisions
```

### Version 2: Business Impact Focus
```

  with dynamic Base/Best/Worst case analysis showing $540K revenue variance across pricing 
  and volume assumptions

• Developed automated financial forecasting system generating 36-month projections including 
  revenue, EBITDA, cash flow, and working capital metrics, with 100% formula traceability 
  for audit compliance

• Built sensitivity analysis framework testing 5 key business levers (pricing, volume, COGS, 
  headcount, CapEx) to quantify financial impact and support strategic decision-making

• Engineered Excel-based financial model with scenario switching capability, allowing CFO-level 
  users to instantly recalculate full P&L and cash flow under different business assumptions 
  without technical support

• Implemented working capital forecasting using DSO/DSI/DPO methodology, accurately projecting 
  cash runway and identifying funding requirements 12-18 months in advance
```

### Version 3: Hybrid (Recommended)
```
• Developed deterministic FP&A forecasting model using Python and Excel, automating 36-month 
  financial projections with scenario analysis (Base/Best/Worst) and sensitivity testing, 
  reducing forecast cycle time by 95%

• Built formula-driven 3-statement financial model (P&L, Cash Flow, Balance Sheet) with 
  INDEX/MATCH scenario switching, enabling executives to instantly analyze impact of pricing, 
  volume, and cost assumptions on cash runway

• Engineered automated testing framework (pytest) validating cash flow reconciliation, working 
  capital calculations, and depreciation waterfall across 13 financial logic checks

• Implemented driver-based forecasting using business assumptions (volume growth, pricing, 
  seasonality, headcount) rather than ML models, ensuring 100% auditability and stakeholder 
  transparency

• Created sensitivity analysis showing $540K annual revenue variance from 10% price changes, 
  supporting data-driven pricing strategy and capital allocation decisions

## Cover Letter Paragraph

```
I recently developed a deterministic FP&A forecasting model that demonstrates my ability to 
bridge technical skills with business needs. The model uses Python to automate 36-month 
financial projections while maintaining 100% formula traceability in Excel—ensuring executives 
can audit every number. Key features include scenario switching (Base/Best/Worst cases), 
sensitivity analysis quantifying the impact of pricing and volume changes, and automated 
working capital forecasting using DSO/DSI/DPO methodology. This project showcases my expertise 
in financial modeling, scenario planning, and building tools that empower non-technical 
stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

"Deterministic FP&A model with automated scenario analysis and formula-driven Excel output"

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"I built a corporate-grade financial forecasting model that generates 36-month projections 
using business drivers like volume growth and pricing—not black-box ML. It's fully automated 
in Python but outputs Excel formulas, so CFOs can audit every calculation. Includes scenario 
switching, sensitivity analysis, and working capital forecasting. All validated with 13 
automated tests."

### Key Metrics
